//! Deploy contains types for deploying contracts.
//!
//! Contracts are assigned an ID that is derived from a set of arguments. A
//! contract may choose which set of arguments to use to deploy with:
//!
//! - [Deployer::with_current_contract] â€“ A contract deployed by the currently
//! executing contract will have an ID derived from the currently executing
//! contract's ID.
//!
//! The deployer can be created using [Env::deployer].
//!
//! ### Examples
//!
//! ```
//! # use soroban_sdk::{contractimpl, BytesN, Env, Symbol};
//! #
//! # pub struct Contract;
//! #
//! # #[contractimpl]
//! # impl Contract {
//! #     pub fn f(env: Env, wasm_hash: BytesN<32>) {
//! #         let salt = [0u8; 32];
//! let deployer = env.deployer().with_current_contract();
//! let contract_address = deployer.deploy(&salt, &wasm_hash);
//! #     }
//! # }
//! #
//! # #[cfg(feature = "testutils")]
//! # fn main() {
//! #     let env = Env::default();
//! #     let contract_address = env.register_contract(None, Contract);
//! #     // Install the contract code before deploying its instance.
//! #     let mock_wasm = [0u8; 100];
//! #     let wasm_hash = env.deployer().upload_contract_wasm(mock_wasm.as_slice());
//! #     ContractClient::new(&env, &contract_address).f(&wasm_hash);
//! # }
//! # #[cfg(not(feature = "testutils"))]
//! # fn main() { }
//! ```
